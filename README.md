# Project encryption / decryption using *Huffman algoritm*

Part_1 is the first part of the project that aims to display a binary tree to a *GUI*.
The *GUI* is building with Qt. We use *GraphViz* to generate a binary tree an *CMake* to build a *Qt* project.To view the GUI we go to process some configuration.

## Install graphviz and CMake

If you are on linux as *OS* you can install *Graphviz* and *CMake* by the following command
`sudo apt-get install graphviz cmake`. You can also execute this command `make config` and 
*Graphviz* and *CMake* will be installed.

## Project building and running

For this step you just type the following command in the terminal `make run` and hide enter.
If *Graphviz* and *CMake* were installed successfully, an interface appear in the screen.
