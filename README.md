# Project encryption / decryption using *Huffman algoritm*

Part_1 is the first part of the project that aims to display a binary tree to a *GUI*.
The *GUI* is building with Qt. We use *GraphViz* to generate a binary tree and *qmake* to generate a *Qt* project.To view the GUI we go to process some configuration.

## Install graphviz and qt5-default

If you are on linux as *OS* you can install *Graphviz* and *qt5-default* by the following command
